# Setup - Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(class)
library(caret)
```

# Load Data

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HAN-M3DM-Data-Mining/data-mining-s2y2122-KelvinWardenaar/master/datasets/KNN-occupancy.csv"
rawDF <- read_csv(url)
```

# Basic Information About Dataset

```{r}
str(rawDF)
```

# Removing Data That Isn't Relevent

```{r}
cleanDF <- rawDF[-2]
head(cleanDF)
```

# Generate The Outcomes We Would Like To Predict

```{r}
cntDiag <- table(cleanDF$Occupancy)
propDiag <- round(prop.table(cntDiag) * 100 , digits = 1)

cntDiag
```

# Converting Them To Percentages

```{r}
propDiag
```

#

```{r}
cleanDF$Occupancy <- factor(cleanDF$Occupancy, levels = c("1", "0"), labels = c("Yes", "No")) %>% relevel("yes")
head(cleanDF, 10)
```

# Summerize The Data

```{r}
summary(cleanDF)
```

# Creating a Normalize Funtion and Creating Testsets

```{r}
normalize <- function(x) { # Function takes in a vector
  return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))) # distance of item value - minimum vector value divided by the range of all vector values
}

testSet1 <- c(1:5)
testSet2 <- c(1:5) * 10

cat("testSet1:", testSet1, "\n")
cat("testSet2:", testSet2, "\n")
```

# Using The Normalize Function On Testsets

```{r}
cat("Normalized testSet1:", normalize(testSet1), "\n")
cat("Normalized testSet2:", normalize(testSet1), "\n")
```

# Creating Vectors

```{r}
nCols <- dim(cleanDF)[1]
cleanDF_n <- sapply(2:nCols,
                    function(x) {
  normalize(cleanDF[,x])
}) %>% as.data.frame()

summary(cleanDF_n)
```

# Creating Feats

```{r}
trainDF_feat <- cleanDF_n[1:5001,  ]
testDF_feat <- cleanDF_n[5001:8143,  ]
```

# Creating Labels

```{r}
trainDF_labels <- cleanDF[1:5000,  1]
testDF_labels <- cleanDF[5001:8143,  1]
```

# Running KNN

```{r}
cleanDF_test_pred <- knn(train = as.matrix(trainDF_feat), test = as.matrix(testDF_feat), cl = as.matrix(trainDF_labels), k = 21)
head(cleanDF_test_pred)
```

# Visualizing It With a Confusion Matrix

```{r}
confusionMatrix(cleanDF_test_pred, testDF_labels[[1]], positive = NULL, dnn = c("Prediction", "True"))
```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
